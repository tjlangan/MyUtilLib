1) int, float / double, complex versions of Array
2) ReturnType struct to handle return types and errors 
typedef struct {
    bool error; 
    union {
        error code enum maybe
        value
    } ReturnType; 
}
could just check boolean then if there is an error send the error code to a function
to print / log the error
3) Make decision about interate function. do you want it to be able modify values or not
